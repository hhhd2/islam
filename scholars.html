      <h2>Ibn Sina (Avicenna)</h2>
      <p>Ibn Sina, also known in the West as Avicenna, was a Persian polymath born in 980 CE in Afshana near Bukhara. Known as the father of early modern medicine, he authored over 450 works, with <em>The Canon of Medicine</em> being his most influential. It remained a central medical text for centuries. His philosophy fused Aristotelianism with Islamic metaphysics, influencing scholars in both the Muslim world and Europe. A master of various fields, including logic, astronomy, and chemistry, he emphasized empirical observation and rational deduction. Ibn Sina died in 1037 CE, leaving a monumental legacy in science and philosophy.</p>

      <h2>Al-Khwarizmi</h2>
      <p>Born around 780 CE, Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. He introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world and authored <em>Kitab al-Jabr</em>, from which the term "algebra" derives. He served in Baghdadâ€™s House of Wisdom, translating Greek and Indian texts into Arabic. His work influenced both Islamic and European scholars, and the word "algorithm" comes from the Latin form of his name. He also contributed significantly to cartography and astronomical tables. Al-Khwarizmi died around 850 CE, and his impact still resonates in mathematics and computing.</p>

      <h2>Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)</h2>
      <p>Ibn al-Haytham, born in 965 CE in Basra, was a pioneering physicist, mathematician, and philosopher, often regarded as the father of modern optics. His work, <em>Book of Optics</em>, corrected ancient theories of vision and introduced a scientific methodology based on experiments. He demonstrated that vision results from light reflecting off objects and entering the eye. Working under the Fatimid Caliphate in Cairo, he also contributed to mechanics, astronomy, and geometry. His approach to scientific inquiry foreshadowed the modern scientific method. Ibn al-Haytham died in 1040 CE, but his legacy endures in the principles of optics and empirical science.</p>
