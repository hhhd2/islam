    <h2>Scientific Innovations of the Islamic Golden Age</h2>
    <img src="images/invention-science.jpg" alt="Islamic Science Innovation">
    <p>
      During the Islamic Golden Age, scientists revolutionized nearly every field: astronomy, medicine, optics, algebra, and chemistry. Scholars like Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) laid the foundation for optics and the scientific method. Al-Razi distinguished between smallpox and measles and pioneered early hospitals. Al-Khwarizmi invented algebra—a term derived from his book “Al-Jabr”.
      <br><br>
      Observatories like Maragha and Samarkand helped calculate planetary motions centuries before European advancements. Arabic translations of Greek, Persian, and Indian works became global reference points. These innovations were not isolated—they were institutionalized in Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom), where scholars collaborated across cultures and faiths, emphasizing reason and observation.

    <h2>Everyday Inventions and Engineering</h2>

    <p>
      Muslims invented tools still in use today: toothbrushes (miswak), coffee, windmills, surgical instruments, and even the concept of the crankshaft. Abbas ibn Firnas attempted early flight mechanisms. Al-Jazari created programmable machines like water clocks and mechanical peacocks. Hydraulics, automation, and irrigation flourished under his influence.
      <br><br>
      In the domestic sphere, Muslims innovated soap-making with vegetable oils and perfumes, contributed to glass manufacturing, and perfected paper production. These advancements weren’t just technical—they shaped public hygiene, urban design, and domestic comfort. Markets thrived due to improved weights and measures, and postal systems connected empires with regularity.

    <h2>Transmission of Knowledge to the World</h2>
    <img src="images/invention-books.jpg" alt="Knowledge Transfer Books">
    <p>
      The Islamic world preserved and enhanced the ancient knowledge of Greeks, Indians, and Persians, and then passed it to Europe. Arabic manuscripts translated into Latin influenced European scholars like Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas. The transmission of works by Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd) was foundational to European Renaissance thought.
      <br><br>
      The invention of paper mills in the Muslim world allowed for mass manuscript production long before printing presses. Libraries like those in Cordoba, Baghdad, and Cairo housed hundreds of thousands of books. Educational institutions—madrasas and universities—standardized knowledge. From navigation maps to astronomical tables, Islamic inventions became global intellectual assets.
