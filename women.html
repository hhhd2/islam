    <h2>Role in Society and Scholarship</h2>
    <img src="images/women-scholars.jpg" alt="Muslim Female Scholars">
    <p>
      Throughout Islamic history, women played essential roles as scholars, teachers, and intellectual leaders. In the time of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, Aisha bint Abi Bakr was known to be a prolific hadith transmitter and legal mind. Women such as Fatima al-Fihri founded institutions like the University of al-Qarawiyyin, the oldest existing and continually operating university in the world. Others, like Zaynab bint al-Kamal, taught in public and attracted hundreds of male and female students from across the Islamic world.  
      <br><br>
      In societies from Baghdad to Timbuktu and Cordoba to Delhi, women had access to libraries, attended lectures, and contributed to jurisprudence and literature. Their names were preserved in ijazahs (certificates of scholarship) and chains of narration. Contrary to modern misconceptions, the Islamic tradition valued knowledge regardless of gender and provided means through which women could thrive intellectually and spiritually. Women's contributions are well documented in biographies such as Ibn Hajar’s *al-Durar al-Kaminah* and *Tabaqat al-Shafi’iyyah*.

    <h2>Political Leadership and Resistance</h2>
    <img src="images/women-leaders.jpg" alt="Women Leaders in Islamic History">
    <p>
      Numerous women held political power, led armies, or played pivotal roles in governance. Shajar al-Durr ruled Egypt after the death of her husband and held off crusader invasions before the Mamluks took over. In Muslim Spain, Subh of Cordoba acted as regent for her son during the Umayyad caliphate. In the Deccan and Horn of Africa, figures like Razia Sultana and Queen Arawelo ruled kingdoms with administrative skill.  
      <br><br>
      Women also took part in resistance movements against colonial and Mongol threats. The likes of Nana Asma’u of Nigeria were not only resistance leaders but educators and poets as well. These leaders weren’t exceptions—they were the result of environments where women were permitted, and at times encouraged, to participate in shaping the fate of their communities. Islamic jurisprudence never barred women from leadership outright, though cultural and political conditions varied.

    <h2>Spiritual & Religious Contributions</h2>
    <img src="images/women-spiritual.jpg" alt="Spiritual Muslim Women">
    <p>
      Spiritually, women have always occupied an essential place in Islamic tradition. The legacy of women saints, ascetics, and spiritual guides is seen across Sufi orders and local traditions. Rabia al-Adawiyya is the most renowned female mystic, known for her deep love of God and influence on early Sufism. Her poetry, reflections, and simplicity made her a model for future generations.  
      <br><br>
      Women participated in pilgrimages, led dhikr circles, and taught spiritual disciplines. In some Sufi lodges, they even served as leaders and guardians of knowledge. In Ottoman Istanbul and Safavid Persia, shrines of female saints were destinations for both men and women. Spiritual equality in Islam is firmly rooted in the Qur’an, where righteousness—not gender—determines honor before God. Muslim women through history sought nearness to Allah by preserving the Qur’an, supporting religious endowments, or silently guiding communities through wisdom and piety.
