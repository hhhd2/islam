    <h2>Prayer and Religious Life</h2>

    <p>
      The Islamic Golden Age (8th–14th century) was marked by both scientific flourishing and deep spirituality. Prayer (ṣalāh) remained the heartbeat of society. Cities like Baghdad, Cordoba, and Cairo echoed with the adhan (call to prayer) from hundreds of intricately designed minarets. Worship during this time reflected spiritual depth and philosophical contemplation.
      <br><br>
      Mosques became more sophisticated and central to urban planning. Leading scholars like Al-Ghazali emphasized the inner dimensions of prayer, while jurists codified ritual purity and congregational etiquette. The Friday khutbah evolved into a sophisticated discourse. Women found participation in religious circles, especially in Hadith transmission.

    <h2>Warfare and Defense</h2>

    <p>
      Warfare in the Golden Age emphasized defense, naval strength, and preservation. Abbasid caliphs built a strong military, with Turkish mamluks forming elite units. Engineers developed siege machines, grenades, and fortification systems. Cities like Baghdad were fortified with concentric walls and towers.
      <br><br>
      Muslim warfare followed ethical principles: protecting civilians, places of worship, and libraries. Warfare reflected strategy, discipline, and intelligence, often enhanced through exchanges with Byzantines and Persians. Scholars like Al-Farabi explored political theory and strategy in military contexts.

    <h2>Architectural Advancements</h2>

    <p>
      Architecture during this era was grand and symbolic. Abbasid architects used domes, arches, tilework, and calligraphy to represent divine harmony. The House of Wisdom in Baghdad was both an academic and architectural marvel. Buildings followed geometric layouts, using the golden ratio and arabesques.
      <br><br>
      Famous works include the Samarra Mosque and Alhambra Palace. Cities like Fes and Marrakesh showcased Moroccan zellige and carved woodwork. Every building served both a function and a message—beauty as devotion, symmetry as faith, and space as spirituality.
