    <h2>Early Battles during Prophet Muhammad’s ﷺ Era</h2>

    <p>
      The formative years of Islam witnessed significant military encounters that shaped the faith’s early community and political reality. The Battle of Badr (624 CE) was the first major confrontation between Muslims and the Quraysh of Makkah. Though outnumbered, the Muslims emerged victorious, a moment celebrated in the Qur’an as divine support for the believers. It marked the rise of the Muslim political presence in Arabia.
      <br><br>
      This was followed by the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench. Uhud tested the believers' discipline, as early success turned to setback due to disobedience. The Trench (Khandaq) showed the brilliance of defensive tactics, with Muslims using Persian-style trench warfare to block a much larger coalition army. Each battle was not just a military clash, but a spiritual and social trial that refined the Muslim community’s resolve and organization.

    <h2>Crusades and Muslim Defense</h2>
    <img src="images/crusades-salahuddin.jpg" alt="Salahuddin and the Crusades">
    <p>
      The Crusades, beginning in 1095 CE, brought massive waves of European invasions into the heart of the Muslim world. Jerusalem fell during the First Crusade in 1099 CE, causing a humanitarian disaster for its Muslim and Jewish inhabitants. In response, Muslim unity began to solidify under powerful leaders such as Nur ad-Din Zangi and eventually Salahuddin Ayyubi.
      <br><br>
      Salahuddin, a Kurdish general, became the symbol of Muslim resistance. His reclaiming of Jerusalem in 1187 CE during the Battle of Hattin was a moment of immense pride for the Islamic world. Unlike the Crusaders, Salahuddin granted safety to Christians in Jerusalem. These wars, fought over religion and territory, highlighted the spiritual, military, and political dimensions of Islamic civilization. The Crusades catalyzed Muslim advancements in military strategy, fortification, and political unity.

    <h2>Mongol Invasions and Islamic Unity</h2>
    <img src="images/mongol-invasions.jpg" alt="Mongol Invasions">
    <p>
      The Mongol invasions of the 13th century were one of the greatest threats the Muslim world had ever faced. Hulagu Khan’s forces swept across Central Asia and the Middle East, culminating in the fall of Baghdad in 1258 CE. The Abbasid Caliphate was extinguished in a brutal massacre, leaving the Islamic heartlands shaken and leaderless.
      <br><br>
      But the story did not end in tragedy. The Mamluks of Egypt, under Sultan Qutuz and later Baybars, decisively defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 CE. It was the first major defeat of Mongol armies, preserving the Islamic world from total collapse. Over time, even the Mongols embraced Islam, with the Ilkhanate converting and establishing Persianate Muslim rule.
      <br><br>
      These wars demonstrated both the vulnerability and resilience of Islamic civilization. Though cities fell and empires crumbled, faith and culture revived with vigor, laying foundations for later golden ages under the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals.
